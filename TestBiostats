schedule
(20*27)/132 # Expected value of 4.1

# Question b

chisq.test(schedule, correct = FALSE)$expected
chisq.test(schedule, correct = FALSE)
# Test statistic: 11.6950
# p-value: 0.0691
# Since the p-value is greater than 0.05 we cannot reject the null hypothesis
# Therefore we must say that there is no association between time scheduled to work
# and diagnosis status in this case.

# Question 2

(14/20)/(6/20) # 2.3333
# Those that are men in Littletown's manufacturing plant 
# are 2.33 times as likely to be diagnosed with the disease
# than those that are women

# Part b
riskratio(sex, rev="b")
chisq.test(sex,correct=FALSE)
# We are 95% confident the risk ratio of sex and being diagnosed is
# between 0.4061 and 1.7891, which tells us that we can't reject the 
# null hypothesis in this case since the lower and upper bound include one in this
# case where if the risk ratio = 1 then we can't reject the null hypothesis in this case
# Therefore the risk ratio here is not seen to be statistically significant
# since the value of 1 lies in the interval for individuals who are diagnosed with the
# disease. 


# Question 3

retired
# What I notice is that there are no people that are retired and diagnosed with the
# disease in the data set. Even though having a 0 value is inconvenient we can still
# run a statistical test since we can compare this data set to the expected values
# and test out our goodness of fit data to observe if the distribution of the observed
# values matches that with the expected distribution where we can still calculate the 
# test statistic since it is squared even if the numerator is negative, the square
# will get rid of the negative for us in this case, and we can then proceed to 
# calculate the p-value. 


# Question 4
Littletownomit <- na.omit(Littletown)

# t-test = -2.407
pt(-2.407491,df=19,lower.tail=TRUE) # p-value = 0.013
# lower.tail = True 
# because we're trying to find if the mean
# is less than 65
# Interpretation:
# We have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis due to the p-value being
# less than 0.05 or the level of significance where the probability of observing
# a more extreme mean than 62.5315 is 0.013 which is incredibly rare, and the t-test being 
# two standard deviations away from the mean as seen with a test statistic of -2.407 
# that tells us that Therefore 
# the mean function score for the age of a diagnosed case
# is statistically significant less than 65.
