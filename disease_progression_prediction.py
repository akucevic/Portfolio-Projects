# Predicting Disease Progression using Random Forest and Time-Series Features

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('disease_progression.csv')  # Includes vitals, lifestyle, genetic markers

# Feature selection
features = [col for col in df.columns if col not in ['date', 'patient_id', 'progression_score']]

# Train-test split

# Model
rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)

# Evaluation
print("RMSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False))
